Simple python blackjack game

Greetings.  This python application was created on 10/10 to fulfill a Udemy course milestone project, but I intend to refine it as a fun side project and excuse to learn how to add GUI elements to my python applications as well as how to create installers for windows or at least a self contained executable.

Current things that need basic level attention:

5. Possibly ASCII characters for card suit indicators rather than C, S, H, D.
6. Multi deck without a shuffle after every game.
